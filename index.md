This page represents the documentation of the KizuEngine framework that will make it easy to the developers to make Replicated games. 

### How to use

2. After starting the editor, you'll be able to enable the KizuEngine Plugin.

|Create a character that inherits from KCharacter and you'll be able to give it all kind of resources Data. This can include health, energy, physical power, magical power, armor, etc. Any kind of Resources owned by the character will be replicated and can be accessed from multiple other functions or events around the game.)|![2](https://hiro-ke.github.io/UE4-KizuEngine/wiki/images/CharacterData.png|
|As an exmaple of some functions, these resources Blueprints offer you the possibility to change the values of the resources. Eventually, you're not obliged to use these unless you want to create some custom system.|![2](https://hiro-ke.github.io/UE4-KizuEngine/wiki/images/ResourcesBP.png)|
